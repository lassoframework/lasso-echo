-- A dated, LASSO-only immediate-drain envelope for the October 2–5 outage.
-- The normal per-account/per-format limit remains three. On October 5 and
-- October 6 ONLY (America/New_York), allow twelve additional posts from the
-- backlog dates (October 2–5, STRICTLY before the publish day) per account
-- and format on each actual publish day, for a 15-row envelope (3 current +
-- 12 backlog). October 5 is never double counted: on an October 5 publish
-- day it is current-day only, on an October 6 publish day it is backlog
-- only. The residual two-extra catchup mode narrows to October 7–11.
-- Caller must pass capacity fifteen only in this window; all other tenants
-- and capacity values retain the preceding owned, media-guarded claim
-- behavior. Capacity, approved_only, day and timezone are NULL-safe: a NULL
-- argument claims nothing.
