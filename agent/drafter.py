"""
Drafter: turns a voice doc + one creative into one post draft.

NO FABRICATION. The default caption generator only recombines text the human
already approved: the brand voice doc and the client-provided note on the
creative. It never invents an offer, a price, a claim, or a fact.

The generator is pluggable. A future LLM generator can slot in here, but it MUST
be constrained to the voice doc + client note and stay inside the same contract.
